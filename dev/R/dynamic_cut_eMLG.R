# Dynamically consolidate cluster-level eMLGs into coarser LD-clusters,
# ahead of using them for global (long-range/cross-chromosome) LD analysis.
#
# Context: ld_complexity_reduction() + merge_ld_clusters() (LDscnR) already
# reduce a chromosome's raw markers to a much smaller set of within-chromosome
# LD clusters, using complete linkage throughout -- appropriate for their
# purpose (LD-pruning: avoid redundant markers, so a strict "every pairwise
# r2 must clear the threshold" guarantee matters). But complete linkage is
# the wrong tool for a different question this file answers: which of THOSE
# clusters' consensus genotypes (eMLGs) still belong together as one
# coherent, hard-callable unit, even if their internal correlation is
# diffuse/moderate rather than uniformly high (the signature of a polygenic
# or epistatically-linked complex, not a single strongly-linked block).
#
# Validated on real Chr26 data (ld_w>0.2 subset, 292 Stage-2 clusters) before
# writing this:
#   - single linkage: catastrophic chaining (292 clusters -> 1 giant group
#     at r2>0.10; still an 81%-of-everything mega-group at r2>0.35)
#   - complete linkage: fragments genuinely coherent diffuse blocks (one
#     45-cluster block with mean internal r2=0.42 split into 31 separate
#     final clusters at the LD-pruning-calibrated rho=0.5 threshold)
#   - average linkage: recovers that same block as ONE cluster, and does so
#     across a much wider/more robust threshold range than complete linkage
#     (which only works in a narrow ~0.10-0.20 window before fragmenting
#     again by 0.25)
#   - a single global r2 threshold (cutree at one height) isn't the right
#     lever anyway, once the actual quality metric that matters is
#     score_eMLG = cor(round(eMLG), eMLG)^2 -- i.e. does the cluster's
#     consensus genotype survive the hard-calling downstream LD/Ohta
#     statistics require. A single height cut doesn't target that directly.
#   - so: walk the average-linkage dendrogram bottom-up (tips -> root, one
#     hclust merge event at a time) and accept each candidate merge only if
#     BOTH (a) the two sides being merged are themselves correlated
#     (min_r2), and (b) the resulting consensus still scores >= threshold on
#     score_eMLG. This lets the stopping point adapt locally per branch,
#     rather than assuming one global r2 threshold is right everywhere.
#   - single linkage was also tried as the TREE structure for this walk
#     (not as the accept/reject criterion, which is score_eMLG/min_r2
#     either way) on the theory that its finer-grained, one-at-a-time
#     candidate steps might give the quality gate more precise control.
#     Empirically this was worse, not better: single linkage's tree
#     fragmented the same 45-cluster block into 7 pieces (vs average
#     linkage's 1), because single linkage proposes candidates by
#     closest-pair-anywhere, which need not fit the group's overall signal
#     well and gets rejected (freezing prematurely) more often than average
#     linkage's already-typical-fit candidates.
#
# Two known bugs fixed during testing, both worth remembering if this is
# ever reimplemented:
#   1. When one side of a candidate merge is already frozen (from an earlier
#      rejected merge) but the OTHER side is still active (a fresh leaf, or
#      an accepted-merge node not yet finalized), that active side must be
#      finalized immediately -- it has nowhere left to grow once its sibling
#      is closed. Missing this silently dropped ~90% of markers (found via a
#      total-member-count check: only 32 of 292 markers survived without
#      this fix).
#   2. score_eMLG alone does not verify the two sides being merged are
#      actually correlated with each other -- two near-monomorphic,
#      unrelated groups can average to something that still rounds cleanly
#      by coincidence (confirmed directly: a merge with min pairwise r2 as
#      low as 1.8e-05 still passed score_eMLG >= 0.80 without the min_r2
#      gate). Hence the min_r2 check alongside score_eMLG.

#' Dynamically cluster eMLG signals via a quality-gated tree walk
#'
#' Consolidates cluster-level consensus genotypes (eMLGs -- e.g. the
#' `eMLG` matrix from [make_eMLGs()] or the equivalent consensus signals
#' `merge_ld_clusters()` builds internally) into coarser groups, by walking
#' an average-linkage dendrogram bottom-up (tips -> root) and accepting each
#' candidate merge only while the result stays hard-callable. This adapts
#' locally per branch, unlike a single global height cut (`cutree()`), which
#' assumes one r2 threshold is right everywhere -- see the file-level
#' comment above for why average linkage (not single or complete) was
#' chosen as the tree, and why the accept/reject decision is driven by
#' `score_eMLG`/`min_r2` directly rather than by tree height.
#'
#' @param eMLG Numeric matrix, individuals x clusters (consensus genotype
#'   per cluster). Column names are used as cluster IDs and must be unique.
#' @param n_loci Named numeric vector, cluster ID -> number of raw markers
#'   in that cluster. Used to weight each side when averaging two groups'
#'   consensus signals together (larger, more evidence-backed clusters
#'   count for more). Must have an entry for every `colnames(eMLG)`.
#' @param threshold Minimum `score_eMLG` (`cor(round(x), x)^2` -- how well
#'   the hard-called genotype round-trips against the continuous consensus)
#'   a candidate merge's resulting signal must clear to be accepted.
#'   Validated around 0.80-0.85 on real Chr26 data; higher is stricter
#'   (less merging).
#' @param min_r2 Minimum r2 required directly between the two sides being
#'   merged, checked in addition to `threshold`. Default `0.2`.
#'
#' @return A list of final groups, each `list(members = <cluster IDs>,
#'   emlg = <consensus genotype vector>, score = <score_eMLG of that
#'   consensus>)`. Every input cluster ID appears in exactly one group.
